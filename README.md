The project was created in Unreal Engine 5.6 using C++ within one month as part of a game jam. All assets were made from scratch. 

Duncan is a humorous 3D action game about a failing blogger who has spent years chasing conspiracy theories, until one day he's abducted by aliens and locked inside Area 52. 
The player must explore levels in search of evidence while avoiding guards. The game features vivid and memorable characters, a distinctive cartoonish art style, 
and an unexpected twist at the end: to defeat the final boss - the main reptilian - you must win a dance-off.
